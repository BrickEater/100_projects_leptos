I'm not actually sure how I want to parse the inputs from the buttons. I know I need to change the equals one since it needs a unique function but the other ones I think I just make a match construct to catch the numbers and parse them to f32's. 
I guess I can make a variable in the display component and then match the values there. I don't quite know how to evaluate the equation once I have all the terms.
