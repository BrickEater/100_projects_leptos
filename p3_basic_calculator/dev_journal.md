I made a clear button that clears whatever is held in the getter function. It wasn't as hard as I thought it was going to be but I still don't quite understand the `*n` syntax. I kinda get that it's a pointer but I need to read more about it. I only used it because I've seen it done like that in the past and it worked.

I'm not actually sure how I want to parse the inputs from the buttons. I know I need to change the equals one since it needs a unique function but the other ones I think I just make a match construct to catch the numbers and parse them to f32's. 
I guess I can make a variable in the display component and then match the values there. I don't quite know how to evaluate the equation once I have all the terms.
